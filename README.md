# 🚀 Flutter Project – Team Setup Guide (RandFoodtek)

Welcome to the `randfoodtek_branch` organized branch! This guide will help each team member connect their local project to GitHub **without losing any local work**, and contribute properly using individual branches.

---

## 🔹 General Notes

- 🚫 **DO NOT** push directly to the `main` or `randfoodtek_branch` branch.
- 👤 Each developer must work on their **own branch**.
- ✅ All changes will be merged after review via **Pull Requests**.

---

## 🔧 Initial Setup (If You Already Have Local Work)

1. Open Terminal in your project's root folder.

2. Check if Git is initialized:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

   If not, run:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. Add the GitHub remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/QaisNimer/BrainstormingDemo.git
   ```

4. Fetch all branches:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

5. Create & switch to your personal branch:

   **For Duha:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b duha-branch
   ```

   **For Alaa:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b alaa-branch
   ```

6. Stage and commit your local work:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit with local work"
   ```

7. Push your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin duha-branch   # if you're Duha
   git push origin alaa-branch   # if you're Alaa
   ```

## 📌 Continuing Work

- Work only in **your own branch**
- Commit and push frequently
- When done, open a **Pull Request** to `randfoodtek_branch` for review
